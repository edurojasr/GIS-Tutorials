## Great place to start and sources


The QGIS community was a really good documentation that is up to date with the
current long term release of QGIS

Where you can find the documentation:

## Latest vs Long Term Release QGIS Versions

So the first thing to explain is that QGIS have 2 versions:

* Latest Release: is the last release form the community, contains the latest
tools, this if for users that want the cutting edge of OpenSource technology in
GIS.
* Long Term Release: this version was at some point cutting edge, but its now
maintained for great stability I recommended this version for organizations or
enterprises that prefer stability over cutting edge functionality.

This tutorials are going to use both versions, this are going to be indicate in
the header of the file alongside the requirements for that particular tutorial
